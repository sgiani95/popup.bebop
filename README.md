Pop-Up Bebop is a Python-based project for creating customizable pop-up style mockup windows. With a humorous and comic-strip-inspired design, it allows you to dynamically specify content for different sections of the window and export the entire interface as an image.

## Features

- **Customizable Layout**: Specify dynamic content for the title, labels, and buttons.
- **Export as Image**: Save the mockup window as a `.png` image directly to your desired path.
- **Comic-Style Design**: Inspired by comic strips for creating humorous content.
- **Simple and Modular**: Easy to use and integrate into larger projects.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `tkinter` (comes pre-installed with Python)
- `Pillow` (for saving the window as an image)

Install `Pillow` using pip if it's not already installed:
```bash
pip install pillow
